# Single-cell transcriptomics reveals antigen-presenting capacity and therapeutic resistance potential of immunomodulatory endothelial cells in colorectal cancer

Please note:
Because part of the process uses online platforms (DAVID, CIBERSORTx) for analysis, this part of the results cannot be obtained through the code. In order to ensure the reproducibility of the results, the analysis results of the online platform have been presented as supplementary materials. You can change the file name of the supplementary material to the following name, and set the working directory correctly, so that you can visualize the corresponding results with subsequent code.
Of course, the parameter Settings of the online platform analysis have been given in the article, you can also use the results of the code export to use the online platform for analysis.

The supplementary tables are corresponding to the code output file as follows.
